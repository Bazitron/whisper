**Note:** the end-user in context of streaming audio would be the Server hosting this application, and the provider would be the clients browser.

*WebSocket* is a protocol providing [full-duplex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-duplex) communications channels over a single [TCP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) connection.  It is designed to be implemented in [web browsers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser) and [web servers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server), but it can be used by any client or server application.
